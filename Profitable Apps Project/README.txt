Project Name: Profitable Apps

Description:
This Project should serve as an example of exploratory data analysis (EDA) to be done at the beginning of an assignment.
We also take a look at a simplified predictive model after exploring the data to determine the feasibility of being able
to predict a successful app (high installs).
This "ad-hoc" projects comprises of the following steps:
    Opening Data
    Cleaning Data
    Feature Engineering
    Imputation
    Statistical Analysis
    Classification Model (Decision Tree)
    Calculating Feature Importance
    Evaluating Performance
    Ensemble Model (Random Forest)
    Tuning Hyper Parameters
    Adjusting Thresholds to Meet Precision/Recall Goals

Installation:
    Python Libraries Frozen in requirements.txt

Caveat:
    This is to be used as an example of the process undertaken for this type of business problem, not an exhaustive
    approach to actually predicting app success on the Google Play Market

Structure:
    Input CSVs and the cleaned data export are stored in the 'Raw_Data' directory.
    The actual script is saved in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) to provide markdown explanations throughout.
