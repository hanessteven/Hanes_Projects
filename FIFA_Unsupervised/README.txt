Project Name: FIFA Unsupervised

Description:
This Project should serve as an example of a generalized clustering process to serve as a teaching tool for those
new to unsupervised learning.
This "ad-hoc" projects comprises of the following steps:
    Opening Data
    Cleaning Data
    Feature Engineering (One Hot Encoding)
    Statistical Analysis
    Elbow Method for Determining Clusters
    Clustering (K-Means)
    Dimensionality Reduction (PCA) for Visuals
    Examples of Post Clustering Data Profiling to Gain insight

Installation:
    Python Libraries Frozen in requirements.txt

Caveat:
    This is to be used as an example of the process undertaken for this type of business problem, not an exhaustive
    approach to actually cluster FIFA midfielders

Structure:
    Input CSVs and the cleaned data export are stored in the main directory.
    The actual script is saved in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) to provide markdown explanations throughout.
